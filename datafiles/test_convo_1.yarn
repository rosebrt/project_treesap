Guy[Green]: This is a new node! The next section will be super long text.
Guy[Green]: This section is super long to test out maximum speech bubble length. The maximum should be about 250 characters. The end of that sentance was about halfway to that length, and now we're at 200 so we're almost there. Ok and there we go.
Guy[Green]: Also worth noting that the maximum response length is only about 60 characters.
	-> Oh snap that's not a lot of text space to answer with!
		Guy[Green]: Ye I know dawg :(
	-> Test jumping back to first section.
		<<jump Start>>
