Righty[Blue]: Hey, have you read the sign?
-> No? <<if not get_quest_data("READ_TEST_SIGN") >>
	Righty[Blue]: Really? You've been in town for three days now and haven't read the sign?
	-> How do you know how long I've been in town?
			Righty[Blue]: You really should see it. It's like our main attraction.
			-> ...you didn't answer my question
				Righty[Blue]: I know you big-city folk probably have much cooler stuff in your fancy museums or whatever. But out here we cherish the little things in life. Things that may not come with a big price tag, but are rich in character.
				Righty[Blue]: You wouldn't understand...
				-> I'm gonna go.
					Righty[Blue]: Yeah come back when you've seen the sign.
			
-> Just read it. It says "I'm a sign". <<if get_quest_data("READ_TEST_SIGN") >>
	Righty[Blue]: I know right??
	Righty[Blue]: It's the best thing I've ever seen!
	-> The pointless self-descriptive sign is?
		Righty[Blue]: Ugh. You just don't appreciate high art.
		
-> Why do you care?
	Righty[Blue]: Because I'm the mayor!
	Righty[Blue]: That's not true, I'm just trying to impress you.
	Righty[Blue]: Did it work?
